## Second Course:- Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

The 2nd Course in the specilization for Deep Learning by DeepLearning.ai. This branch includes all the programming assignments for the same dated  21/07/2021.
The course link can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)

Brief description of the course:-
In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 

By the end, you will learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

The Deep Learning Specialization is our foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for you to gain the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to your work, level up your technical career, and take the definitive step in the world of AI.

## The third course:- Structuring Machine Learning Projects

The 3rd Course in the specilization for Deep Learning by DeepLearning.ai.You will learn how to build a successful machine learning project and get to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader.

Since this course contained only theoretical assignments. I have opted out of entering the assignments in the repo.

By the end, you will be able to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies for reducing errors; understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

This is also a standalone course for learners who have basic machine learning knowledge. This course draws on Andrew Ngâ€™s experience building and shipping many deep learning products. If you aspire to become a technical leader who can set the direction for an AI team, this course provides the "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.
